Graceful degredation starts with maximum tech and functionality, and gracefully handles states when something fails. Service workers represent that since it allows for functionality when network conditions degrade, if something's offline they can load things for the web app still. The service worker is a safety net when something fails in the software, which is what graceful degredation is.
